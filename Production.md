# Production

## Projection
* Projection screen to side of panel (e.g. tripod projection screen)
* 2:1 projector (or as available) likely from further back in the room? - would prefer to use short throw and higher resolution (e,g, Mitsubishi WD500U)

## Video content
### During rounds
Webcam which is sticky-taped onto the microphone (via PC)
* Logitech C910
* Need some light onto the desk

### During intermissions / walk in
A slide show of provocative images:
* Similar projects
	* Greg Borenstein / the tumblr version
	* Zaha Hadid / China copy
	* Examples from Golan’s presentation
	* Sand + kinect + projection
	* Face + animal reflection project 
	* Girl Talk
	* [Kitten vs Urban Outfitters](http://i.imgur.com/OWSqejL.jpg)
	* FE flyer design tumblr.
	* Any music artists famous for plagarising or inventing a style?
* First movers / low hanging fruit
	* Memo’s quadrotor show
	* Building projection mapping
* Other references
	* Pirate bay
	* FLOSS
	* China rip off mobile phones (Z8)

## Stage setting
* Raised stage decking
* Table (could be quite small / cramped)
* Four stools for participants
* Chair set slightly forwards to the side for MC (often they are standing)

## Audio
* 2 wired mic’s
* FOH set forwards from panelists. If this is not possible, then we need EQ / spectrum analyser (e.g. phone app?)
* Music playlist #1 - entrance and intermission
	* Any songs about plagarism / having an idea
* Music playlist #2 - after debate is complete
	* Ideally a mix that we can play

## Lighting
* Lighting onto faces of panelists, away from projection screen (profile or parcans)
* Lighting from above onto table (fresnel)
* House lighting (fresnels)
* Likely need to improvise with the lighting available in the venue
