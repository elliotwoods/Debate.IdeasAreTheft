“Ideas are theft” is an evening debate in a timed quick fire format. The style is casual and feisty, and there will be a free bar to encourage the conversation flow. This event is styled after the Flux Factory Death Match which ‘brings online debates into real space’ (see http://www.fluxfactory.org/events/flux-death-match-the-new-aesthetic/).

The debate topic surrounds the value of ideas. We’re looking to discuss the role of implicit IP within creative practise. Our aim is to present critique of motives, paradigms and principles in this area.

We hope the debate will touch on:
* Radical openness / plagarism being a platform for artists to have their work further disseminated (with or without credit)
* Artists demanding credit for ideas
* The ‘Cult of the idea’, where ideas are valued above all else.
* Notes from Golan Levin’s “New-Media Artists are the Unpaid R&D of Ad Agencies” (http://www.flong.com/blog/2012/new-media-artists-are-the-unpaid-research-division-of-ad-agencies/)
* Plagarism between acquaintances, colleagues and collaborators. 

We would be delighted if you would take part in this debate as one of four panelists, in order to articulate and defend your perspective, and to scrutinise views of the other panel members.

Visual aids are encouraged, which will be echoed to a projection screen from a webcam attached to the microphone (e.g. drawings, phone screens and other ad-hoc visual media). No direct connection to the projector is permitted).

The debate will be presented by Joel Gethin Lewis (This Happened / Hellicar and Lewis) along with Drew Hemment (FutureEverything festival director).
