# Overview
* started with a meet and greet argument on net art 2.0 (marius and lyndsay). (flowed out from an argument at a Meet and Greet)
* taking online debates into realspace.
* holding people accountable to waht they said and done online.
* new aesthetic : bruce sterling sent in questions
* panelists need to be prepared to make idiots of themselves. they need willingness to allow this to happen.
* power struggle. people who believe they have power. people who are good at exploiting power. 
* flux is proud to appeal to diverse audience. beyond cultural organisations -> community organisation.
